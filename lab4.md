ESP32 Web Server for Temperature Monitoring and LED Control
This project sets up an ESP32 as a web server to display temperature and hall sensor readings and control an LED via a web interface. Access the server from any device on the same Wi-Fi network.

Requirements
Hardware: ESP32 microcontroller, onboard or external LED (GPIO pin 13)
Software: MicroPython, Wi-Fi network
Project Files
espserver.py:
Connects ESP32 to Wi-Fi
Serves a webpage displaying sensor data and LED control buttons

espclient.py
Setup Instructions
Edit Wi-Fi Credentials:

In espserver.py, update ssid and password with your Wi-Fi credentials.
Upload and Run:

Upload espserver.py to the ESP32 and run it.
Access the Webpage:

Once connected, the ESP32 will print its IP address to the console.
Open the IP in a browser on the same Wi-Fi network.
Features
Webpage Display:

Shows temperature and hall sensor readings.
Displays current LED state with buttons to toggle LED on/off.
Real-Time Control:

Click “RED ON” to turn on the LED and “RED OFF” to turn it off.
Troubleshooting
Wi-Fi Issues: Double-check SSID/password and ensure the ESP32 is within range.
Webpage Not Loading: Verify you’re on the same Wi-Fi network and using the correct IP address.
