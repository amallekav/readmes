# Image Relighting Project

This repository contains all necessary files and scripts for a portrait relighting project. The project uses a deep neural network to relight portraits and seamlessly integrate them with different backgrounds, inspired by the "Total Relighting" framework. The project includes an interactive RGB slider tool that enables user-driven customization of lighting effects, making it flexible for digital content creation and visual effects.

## Directory Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- **data/**: Contains input images and sample data used for relighting experiments.
  - `input_image.jpg`: Example portrait image.
  - `background_images/`: Sample backgrounds for testing integration with relighted portraits.

- **model/**: Contains model architecture files.
  - `model_architecture.py`: Defines the neural network architecture for portrait relighting.

- **result_1024/**: Stores relighted images generated by the model.
  - `output_image.jpg`: Example relighted portrait saved here after processing.

- **trained_model/**: Contains the pre-trained model weights required for relighting. 
  - `trained_model_1024_03.t7`: Model weights that the script loads to perform relighting.

- **utils/**: Utility scripts required for processing and lighting transformations.
  - `utils_normal.py`: Functions for basic image processing.
  - `utils_SH.py`: Functions to handle spherical harmonics calculations for realistic lighting effects.
  - `utils_shtools.py`: Additional tools supporting spherical harmonics for relighting.

- **lighting_files/**: Contains data files with predefined lighting parameters used for relighting transformations.
  - `rotate_light_00.txt` to `rotate_light_06.txt`: Files specifying different lighting configurations based on spherical harmonics.

- **testNetwork_demo_1024.py**: Main Python script that manages the relighting process. This script:
  - Loads the input portrait image.
  - Processes it through the model using trained weights.
  - Applies lighting transformations based on spherical harmonics.
  - Saves the relighted output in the `result_1024` folder.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and access to a compatible environment that can install necessary libraries during runtime. Required libraries will be installed in the notebook as part of the setup process:
   - **PyTorch**: For loading and running the neural network model.
   - **OpenCV**: For image processing.
   - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing images.
   - **NumPy**: For array manipulations.
   - **Tkinter**: For the interactive RGB slider tool (ensure your environment supports GUIs).
   
   The notebook includes commands to install these dependencies automatically when you reach the corresponding cells.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to GPU**:
   - Make sure your environment is connected to a GPU for optimal performance.

2. **Upload the Compressed Folder**:
   - Upload the compressed `DPR-master.zip` folder in the first cell of the notebook. It should be titled `DPR-master.zip`.

3. **Run Each Cell in Sequence**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to complete setup and the relighting process. The main steps include:
     - **Import Libraries**: Loads necessary libraries.
     - **Load Model and Utilities**: Sets up the pre-trained model weights from `trained_model/` and utility functions from `utils/`.
     - **Load Input Image**: Loads the input portrait image from `data/`, preprocessed and prepared for relighting.
     - **Relight the Portrait**: The model applies lighting transformations to the portrait using spherical harmonics, saving the results in the `result_1024` folder.

4. **Use the Interactive RGB Slider Tool**:
   - This interactive tool is essential for refining the relighting output by allowing users to manually adjust lighting properties after the portraits are relight.
     - **Red Slider**: Adjusts red intensity, adding warmth or reducing it for cooler tones.
     - **Green Slider**: Controls vibrancy and color balance.
     - **Blue Slider**: Modifies cool tones, affecting shadow depth and contrast.
   - Each slider change updates the image instantly, allowing users to create the desired lighting effect through fine-tuning.

5. **View Results**:
   - The final images will be displayed in the Jupyter notebook and stored in the `result_1024` folder.
   - You can view the relighted portraits directly in the notebook or download them for further use.

### Notes

- **Input and Expected Outputs**: The input images and anticipated outputs are sourced from the "Deep Single Portrait Image Relighting" repository by Zhou et al. (2019). These expected results help validate the accuracy of the model's relighting performance.
- **Directory Structure**: Ensure the directory structure within `DPR-master` remains unchanged, as the paths in the notebook depend on this setup.
